SYSTEM INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

1. Configure, make and install. 

   $ prefix=/opt/dsnp
   $ ./configure --prefix=$prefix
   $ make
   $ make install

2. Ensure that the data directory is writable by the user that the webserver
   runs as.

   $ chown www-data:www-data $prefix/var/lib/dsnp

3. Add an entry for DSNP to /etc/services. 

   # Local services
   dsnp            7085/tcp

4. Install xinetd. Add a config fragment for DSNPd. You may wish to adjust the
   parameters. The user should also be able to write to the data directory. 

   service dsnp
   {
       disable          = no
       socket_type      = stream
       protocol         = tcp
       wait             = no
       user             = www-data
       instances        = UNLIMITED
       per_source       = UNLIMITED
       cps              = 10000 1
       server           = /opt/dsnp/bin/dsnpd
   }


SITE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

You can run more than one site on a single system. Each site has it's own
database.

1. Generate config and script fragments for the site. This script will ask you
   for site name, URI, and database credentials. It will then generate two
   fragments. One goes in $prefix/etc/dsnpd.conf the other in
   $prefix/etc/config.php

   $ ./new-site.sh instructions

   The output file will contain instructions for generating the new site.
   Follow these instructions.

2. Install/upgrade the databases. This script will get the credentials from the
   config files and will create the database user and database.

3. Acquire/generate generate certs for the the site and set the appropriate
   options in the dsnpd.conf file. You need a key file, certificate file and a
   list of certificate authorities to trust. If you wish to generate a
   self-signed cert there is 

   CFG_TLS_CA_CERTS = /path/to/certificate-authority-cert-list.crt
   CFG_TLS_CRT = /path/to/certificate.crt
   CFG_TLS_KEY = /path/to/private-key.key
