REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTALLATION 
=============================

1. You must have root privileges on your system. You need to be able to install
   a new service.

2. You need to have the mysql server and client library installed. You need the
   ability to create new databases and users.

3. You need the openssl development package installed on your system.

4. If you are building from the source repository, you need Ragel installed.

UBUNTU PACKAGES
===============

If you are running ubuntu, install these packages:

    mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev libssl-dev 

REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH SITE
==========================

You must have an SSL certificate for the site you wish to host. This is a
requirement of the DSNP protocol. The SSL cert will be used to protect pages
that are served by apache, and it will be used by the DSNP daemon when it
serves up public keys.

SYSTEM INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

First create users for DSNPd and the DSNP Key Agent. If you need to install
apache, do this now as well so the apache user is available.

   $ adduser --system --no-create-home --group dsnpd
   $ adduser --system --no-create-home --group dsnpk

   $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX \
                 --with-dsnpd-user=dsnpd \
                 --with-dsnpk-user=dsnpk \
                 --with-notif-user=www-data \
		 --with-ca-cert-file=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt \
		 --with-pid-dir=/var/run

   $ make
   $ sudo make install

The system install instructions are generated run the init-system script, then
follow the instructions in the output.

SITE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

You can run more than one content manager installation (site) on a single
system. Each site requires a few configuration steps in the DSNP daemon and in
the Content Manager. The new-site script here is for the daemon half of the
site configuration. This script will ask you a few questions, then will
generate the steps for you to follow.
