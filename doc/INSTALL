SITE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. Configure, make and install. 

$ prefix=/opt/dsnp
$ ./configure --prefix=$prefix

2. Ensure that the data directory is writable by the user that the webserver
runs as.

$ chown www-data:www-data $prefix/var/lib/dsnp

3. Add an entry for DSNP to /etc/services. 

# Local services
