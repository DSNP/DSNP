INTIALIZATION
=============

To initialize a new installation you will need to know its public URI and the
root@localhost password for the MySQL database. You will also need to choose an
admin password for the installation. This will be used as the password for the
dsnp user in the database.

Run the ./init.sh script.

The installation script will create:
	./dsnpd/dsnpd.conf

Set up xinetd (a sample config file is given in dsnpd/) and make sure it
receives dsnpd.conf as the first argument. The port for the DSNP service in
/etc/services should be the same as the port specified in the dsnpd.conf file.
