DEPENDENCIES
============

Install and run this package you will need a few things.

1. Apache with mod_rewrite installed. It must be configured to work in
   .htaccess files.

2. Mysql installed and running.

3. PHP with Mysql and XML support

4. To build sppd: ragel, libssl and libmysql.

5. To run sppd: xinetd (or similar).

INTIALIZATION
=============

To initialize a new installation you will need to know its public URI and the
root@localhost password for the database. You will also need to choose an admin
password for the installation. This will be used as the password for the spp
user in the database, as well as for the admin user for web-based
administration of the installation.

Run the ./init.sh script.

The installation script will create:
	./php/config.php
	./sppd/sppd.conf

Copy the PHP scripts (or make an alias) to the public URI you gave to the init
script.

Set up xinetd (a sample config file is given in sppd/) and make sure it
receives sppd.conf as the first argument. The port for the spp service in
/etc/services should be the same as the port specified in the PHP and sppd
config files.
