SYSTEM INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

1. Configure, make and install. 

   $ prefix=/opt/dsnp
   $ ./configure --prefix=$prefix
   $ make
   $ make install

2. Ensure that the data directory is writable by the user that the webserver
   runs as.

   $ chown www-data:www-data $prefix/var/lib/dsnp

3. Add an entry for DSNP to /etc/services. 

   # Local services
   dsnp            7085/tcp

4. Install xinetd. Add a config fragment for DSNPd. You may wish to adjust the
   parameters. The user should also be able to write to the data directory. 

   service dsnp
   {
       disable          = no
       socket_type      = stream
       protocol         = tcp
       wait             = no
       user             = www-data
       instances        = UNLIMITED
       per_source       = UNLIMITED
       cps              = 10000 1
       server           = /opt/dsnp/bin/dsnpd
   }


SITE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

You can run more than one site on a single system. Each site has it's own
database. To add a site to the system run the new-site script. This script will
ask you for site name, URI, and database credentials. It will then generate
instructions, config fragments and various script fragments to install the new
site. Run it, then follow the instructions.

$ $prefix/share/dsnp/new-site /tmp/instructions
